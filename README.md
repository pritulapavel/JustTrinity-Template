## 🎨 SCSS Tips

* Use **mixins** and **variables** to avoid repeating code
* Create **separate files** for different components and then import them into `styles.scss`
* Always use Mobile first then check that styles are responsive across different screen sizes (Tablet, PC)

---

## ⚠️ Git Team Guidelines

* Never make changes directly on the `main` branch
* Regularly **pull** updates from other team members
* Write detailed commit messages describing what changed
* Branch names should be clear: `feature/comment`, `feature/navigation`

## 💡 Pro Tip

> “Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad.” – Keep your code functional but understandable for the team.
